Why use rate limiting?
    - prevent overload
    - fairness
    - prevent abuse of resources
    - cost reduction

Common rate limiting algorithms-
    - token bucket algorithm
    - leaky bucket algorithm
    - fixed window counter
    - sliding window log
    - sliding window counter

* Token Bucket Algorithm
    - fixed number of requests per window
    - smooths out bursts of requests over time
    - more flexible and efficient for handling variable traffic patterns
    - slightly more complex to implement than fixed window
    - requires precise time-based operations to add tokens

* Fixed Window Algorithm
    - divides time into fixed-size intervals(windows)
    - simple to implement and easy to understand
    - less flexible
    - can lead to bursts of requests at boundary of windows
    - not as flexible or smooth in rate limiting as other algorithms

* Leaky Bucket Algorithm
    - controls the rate by using tokens
    - controls rate, smooth and predictable
    - prevents sudden bursts of traffic
    - may lead to request loss
    - less flexible for handling variable traffic patterns compared to token bucket


The thundering herd problem in rate limiting occurs when many clients or servers try to access a resource simultaneously after a period of unavailability, causing a sudden spike in requests that can overwhelm the system
